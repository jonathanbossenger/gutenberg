## API

<!-- START TOKEN(Autogenerated API docs) -->

### Awareness

Similar to Yjs, the Awareness protocol should not be considered a public API. It is a third-party library that will experience breaking changes in the future.

In general, awareness for core entity types is implemented by the `core-data` package and third-party Yjs providers should not provide their own awareness implementation. However, it may be desirable for custom entities to have a custom awareness implementation.

### privateApis

Private @wordpress/sync APIs.

### Y

Yjs should not be considered a public API. It is a third-party library that _will_ experience breaking changes in the future. However, in order to allow third-party plugins to provide their own Yjs providers / sync transport, they must import and consume **our instance** of Yjs due to this bug / feature:

<https://github.com/yjs/yjs/issues/438>

In other words, external code must be able to import Yjs from the `@wordpress/sync` package in their code, e.g.:

```ts
import { Y } from '@wordpress/sync';
```

Additionally, this import must resolve to `wp.sync` via `DependencyExtractionWebpackPlugin`. If you are using an older version of `@wordpress/scripts` that does not treat `@wordpress/sync` as an unbundled package, then you can use Webpack externals to manually resolve the package to the global `wp.sync` variable:

```ts
externals: {
  ...existingConfig.externals,
  // Resolve @wordpress/sync to the global `wp.sync` provided by WordPress.
  '@wordpress/sync': 'wp.sync',

  // Resolve Yjs to the global `wp.sync.Y` provided by the sync package.
  // Since dependencies import 'yjs' directly, we need to avoid importing
  // and packaging two different Yjs instances, which would result in this
  // conflict:
  //
  // https://github.com/yjs/yjs/issues/438
  yjs: 'wp.sync.Y',
},
```

### YJS_VERSION

The major version of Yjs that is bundled and exported by this package. This can be used by third-party code to ensure that they are targeting a compatible version of Yjs.
