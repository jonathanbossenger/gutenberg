## Block Types

- **Static blocks** save HTML markup directly in the post content.
- **Dynamic blocks** are rendered server-side via PHP on each page load. They store only a block comment with JSON attributes in post content.
- **Hybrid blocks** save static HTML but also have server-side rendering that may augment or override the saved markup.
