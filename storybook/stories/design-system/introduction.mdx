# WordPress Design System

## What is a Design System?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, design tokens, and guidelines that work together to create consistent, accessible user interfaces. It serves as a single source of truth that bridges design and development, ensuring cohesion across different parts of an application.

Rather than building UI elements from scratch each time, a design system provides pre-built, themeable components built on a foundation of design tokens. Design tokens encode design decisions like colors, spacing, and typography and can be customized to match different contexts while maintaining consistency.

## How is this different from existing components?

While similar in scope to the existing [`@wordpress/components`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components) package, there are key differences:

-   **Cohesive by design**: Unlike `@wordpress/components`, which grew organically as a collection of unrelated UI elements, this design system guarantees user- and developer-facing cohesion through a unified token system and consistent component patterns.
-   **Flexible theming**: Built from the ground up to support customizable color schemes, adjustable density, and user personalization—capabilities needed to support the [Phase 3 admin redesign initiative](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/71196).
-   **Modern distribution**: Distributed as a versioned npm package following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), rather than being bundled as a WordPress script on the `window.wp` global.
-   **Composable architecture**: Components follow consistent patterns with proper composability, ref forwarding, and flexible rendering—avoiding the bloated abstractions that emerged from historical scope creep.

For more context on the motivations and goals behind this work, see the [Design System: Support for admin redesign](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/71196) overview issue.

## What are the parts of the design system?

The WordPress Design System consists of two complementary packages:

### Theming (`@wordpress/theme`)

The foundational layer that provides:

-   **Design Tokens**: A comprehensive system of design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, and more.
-   **Theme Provider**: A component that accepts seed values and automatically generates consistent, accessible color ramps and spacing scales.

Explore the [Theme documentation](/story/design-system-theme-introduction--docs) to learn more about design tokens, the token architecture, and how to use `ThemeProvider`.

### Components (`@wordpress/ui`)

A library of React UI components built on the theme foundation:

-   **Consistent patterns**: All components follow a consistent set of technical design principles to ensure that their usage is easy to understand and predictable.
-   **Token-driven styling**: Components use design tokens for all visual properties, ensuring they automatically adapt to theme changes.
-   **Accessible by default**: Built with WordPress accessibility coding standards in mind, including semantic markup, keyboard navigation, and proper color contrast.

Explore the [Components documentation](/story/design-system-components-introduction--docs) to learn more about the component library and usage patterns.
