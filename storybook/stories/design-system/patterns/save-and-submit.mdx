# Save & Submit

Guidelines for form submission and saving settings.

## Feedback

The following feedback patterns help users interpret save and submit results.

### Saving

- While saving the button state switches to a busy or loading state.
- A [Snackbar](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/docs/components-snackbar--docs) confirms a successful save.

### No unsaved changes

When all changes are saved the Save button is disabled and reveals a “No unsaved changes” tooltip on hover or focus.

### Invalid fields

If the save or submit fails due to user error (an invalid field or a required field is omitted) then the page scrolls with animation to the first invalid field, which shows a validation error message.

### Failed save

If the save process fails for any reason the user is notified via `ConfirmDialog`.

### Auto-save

- Auto-saving is restricted to `ToggleControl` fields.
- Follows the same feedback conventions as other save methods.
- It is preferable to use a toggle instead of a checkbox for turning features on and off. The exception would be if the checkbox is part of a form with other fields that also need to be updated at the same time.
- Keep labels short. Use the description under the toggle or in the card title to provide more context.
- Lead labels with a verb like “Use, Allow, Show,” or “Enable”.
